Things to do for this project:

plans and ideas:
	- add grid were specific objects can snap too
		> Add a check box to show/hide grid
	- have the ability to snap to block grid or free float
		> Add a check box to enable grid snapping
	- output text file has the detail where things belong
		> file format per line: <onGrid> <layer> <position X> <position Y> <animation tag> etc.
	- text above the object that's show current position when it is being dragged
	- display the camera center view
	- position the level editor menu at the top-right corner
	- add a selector to select the animation state of an entity
		> entity should only be able to change into a new state if they have the state
			-> Use textureTag to check this
		> with textureTag make a new dropdown menu
	- add different menu options as a dropdown
